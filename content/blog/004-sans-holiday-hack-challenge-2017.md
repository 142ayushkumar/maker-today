## Introduction
---

The following post outlines the technical steps taken to complete the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2017.

Full Post will go live after the report submission deadline on 10th of January 2018.

## North Pole and Beyond Story

The Online portion of this years SANS Holiday Hack can be seen in the following overworld map.

<img class="img-responsive image-box-shadow" src="/img/blog/2017/12/hhc2017-map-overview.png" />

Each level had a few places that points could be earned:

* **A Physics based Snowball challenge** where you were required to complete a set of level specific challenges by directing a snowball around a map. The items you use to redirect the snowball were slowly unlocked as you progressed through the levels.
* An extra point and achievement was also awarded for **100% all the challenges associated with each level**.
* **Terminal challenge** where the goal was to perform a small task defined within a docker container that is served up where you click the little Terminal icon found in each map. <img class="img-responsive image-box-shadow" src="/img/blog/2017/12/hhc2017-terminal-icon.png" />

In this guide I will only be covering the terminal challenges for each level, as the physics based challenges were a little hit and miss and are difficult to describe without being able to run them. I will however [link to this album](https://imgur.com/t/holiday_hack_challenge/k912e) that contains a general overview of the solutions.

I broke the candy cane striper, and I'm near throwing a tantrum.
Assembly lines have stopped since the elves can't get their candy cane fix.
We hope you can start the striper once again, with your vast bag of tricks.

My name is Pepper Minstix, and I need your help with my plight.
I've crashed the Christmas toy train, for which I am quite contrite.
I should not have interfered, hacking it was foolish in hindsight.
If you can get it running again, I will reward you with a gift of delight.

My name is Shinny Upatree, and I've made a big mistake.
I fear it's worse than the time I served everyone bad hake.
I've deleted an important file, which suppressed my server access.
I can offer you a gift, if you can fix my ill-fated redress.

## Santa Web Attacks
---

### Letters to Santa

**Task:** Investigate theÂ Letters to SantaÂ application atÂ https://l2s.northpolechristmastown.com. What is the topic ofÂ The Great BookÂ page available in the web root of the server? What is Alabaster Snowball's password?


### SMB File Server

**Task:** The North Pole engineering team uses a Windows SMB server for sharing documentation and correspondence. Using your access to theÂ Letters to SantaÂ server, identify and enumerate the SMB file-sharing server. What is the file server share name?


### Elf Web Access

**Task:** Elf Web Access (EWA) is the preferred mailer for North Pole elves, available internally atÂ http://mail.northpolechristmastown.com. What can you learn fromÂ The Great BookÂ page found in an e-mail on that server?

### Naughty and Nice List

**Task:** How many infractions are required to be marked as naughty on Santa's Naughty and Nice List? What are the names of at least six insider threat moles? Who is throwing the snowballs from the top of the North Pole Mountain and what is your proof?

### Elf as a Service

**Task:** The North Pole engineering team has introduced an Elf as a Service (EaaS) platform to optimize resource allocation for mission-critical Christmas engineering projects atÂ http://eaas.northpolechristmastown.com. Visit the system and retrieve instructions for accessingÂ The Great BookÂ page fromÂ **C:\greatbook.txt**. Then retrieveÂ The Great BookÂ PDF file by following those directions. What is the title of The Great Book page?

### Elf-Machine Interfaces

**Task:** Like any other complex SCADA systems, the North Pole uses Elf-Machine Interfaces (EMI) to monitor and control critical infrastructure assets. These systems serve many uses, including email access and web browsing. Gain access to the EMI server through the use of a phishing attack with your access to the EWA server. RetrieveÂ The Great BookÂ page fromÂ **C:\GreatBookPage7.pdf**. What doesÂ The Great BookÂ page describe?

### North Pole Elf Database

**Task:** Fetch the letter to Santa from the North Pole Elf Database atÂ http://edb.northpolechristmastown.com. Who wrote the letter?
